Notes for the readme that eventually might be...

Contexts:
plant, status, medium options

- these are likely going to get used all over the place, so made into contexts to grab quickly and easily without prod drilling
- exporting provider and useContext from same file

Modals:

- custom modal wrapper to keep things clean
- using `modalval` attribute on buttons in the dashboard to do custom handleModal function.

Filters:

- filterdPlants is what gets shown
- appliedFilters is to hold state for what property filters to apply and what to filter out

NewPlant:

NewPropagation:
